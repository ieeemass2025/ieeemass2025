                <p style="color: rgb(178, 7, 7);font-weight: bold;">Time: 8:45-9:45am,  Monday, Oct. 6, 2025</p>

                <h5><b>Abstract: </b></h5>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The rapid proliferation of edge, or Smart-X, devices—including IoT systems, smartphones, AR/VR headsets, delivery drones, and autonomous vehicles—has unlocked unprecedented opportunities for intelligent, on-device sensing and computing. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the driving force behind this transformation, enabling efficient and powerful applications such as immersive AR/VR platforms, intelligent audio assistants, and real-time in-baggage threat detection. Yet, the same reliance on AI also exposes critical vulnerabilities, raising new security concerns in real-world deployment. This talk will present recent advancements in AI-enabled edge sensing and computing through hardware–software co-design and on-device AI, emphasizing methods that achieve efficient inference under resource constraints. At the same time, it will examine emerging attack surfaces—such as adversarial and backdoor attacks—that threaten the trustworthiness of Smart-X devices. Case studies in AR/VR and intelligent edge-based audio systems will illustrate both opportunities and risks. Finally, the talk will highlight forward-looking strategies, including domain-invariant modeling, that simultaneously enhance efficiency and strengthen resilience, paving the way for secure, next-generation edge sensing and computing.</p>

            <p style="color: rgb(178, 7, 7);font-weight: bold;">Time: 8:45-9:45am, Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2025</p>

            <h5><b>Abstract:</b></h5>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Generative AI is revolutionizing smart IoT ecosystems by embedding reasoning and intelligent decision-making capabilities directly into physical devices and systems. Unlike traditional IoT devices that primarily collect and transmit data, embodied AI transforms passive IoT systems into active intelligent ecosystems, by enabling IoT devices to predict physical interactions and adapt their behavior based on environmental changes, user patterns, and system dynamics. In this talk I will highlight our recent research on world model based autonomous driving (AD), as an outstanding example in smart IoT ecosystems. Thanks to its inherent capacity to extrapolate and anticipate outcomes in unseen situations, world model possesses generative AI capabilities that render it particularly adept for autonomous driving tasks requiring planning and foresight. This predictive prowess and self-supervised learning capability allows AD agents to proactively plan and make decisions that go beyond the current environment. World Model’s low-dimensional latent representation allows for lightweight communication between AD agents, for better coordination to improve safety. I will also talk about CarDreamer, an open-source reinforcement learning platform we developed to integrate world model with CARLA for autonomous driving. In summary, smart IoT systems can leverage world models to maintain comprehensive representations of their operational environments, enabling predictive maintenance, intelligent resource optimization, and proactive system adjustments.</p>
